Pattern matching issue fixed by reordering pattern matching priority (explicit user requests now checked first) and refining the regex pattern from `r'\\b(need fresh|need current|need latest|need up-to-date)\\b'` to `r'\\bneed\\b.*(fresh|current|latest|up-to-date)'` to properly handle phrases like \"I need the latest up-to-date information\".\n\n3. Text matching issue fixed by correcting case sensitivity in assertion from \"no API key configured\" to \"no api key configured\".\n\nFinal test results: 24/24 tests passing (100% success rate).\n\nThe OpenRouter integration is now complete with proper API key configuration, authentication headers, endpoint usage, request/response formatting, error handling, and security best practices.

Allow for future expansion of criteria.\n<info added on 2025-07-05T20:53:54.134Z>\nThe external routing criteria have been comprehensively implemented and tested in the determine_external_need function. The implementation includes five key routing criteria categories:\n\n1. SPECIALIZED_KNOWLEDGE: Detects queries requiring latest information on financial markets, news, weather, sports, celebrities, and business\n2. COMPLEX_TOOL_USE: Identifies patterns for web search, API usage, database operations, deployments, communications, and file operations\n3. USER_EXPLICIT_REQUEST: Recognizes explicit requests for external services, specific models, or up-to-date information\n4. RECENT_INFORMATION: Detects queries about current events, latest updates, and recent developments\n5. LOCAL_MODEL_FAILURE: Implements fallback criteria for scenarios where local models are insufficient\n\nThe routing decision logic employs a priority-based pattern matching system with explicit requests receiving highest priority, a confidence scoring system with thresholds between 0.3-0.5, and comprehensive reasoning for each routing decision. The implementation is designed with an extensible pattern system to accommodate future criteria.\n\nTesting has been completed with a 100% success rate across 24 test cases, covering all routing criteria with multiple query examples, edge cases, and error conditions. Performance and caching functionality have been verified. The implementation adheres to our local-first philosophy by requiring explicit confidence thresholds before routing externally.\n\nThe external routing criteria implementation is now complete and ready for integration with the user consent mechanism in subtask 5.4.\n</info added on 2025-07-05T20:53:54.134Z>",
