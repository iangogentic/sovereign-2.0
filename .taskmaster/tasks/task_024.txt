# Task ID: 24
# Title: Migrate Voice I/O to VoiceService
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the application to isolate microphone and speaker handling into a dedicated VoiceService that implements lazy loading, improving modularity and startup performance.
# Details:
1. Create a new VoiceService class:
   - Implement singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists
   - Design interface for microphone input and speaker output operations
   - Implement lazy loading mechanism that initializes audio components only on first use
   - Add configuration options for audio devices, sampling rates, and quality settings
   - Create abstraction layer to handle platform-specific audio implementations

2. Refactor microphone input implementation:
   - Move microphone initialization and recording code to VoiceService
   - Implement buffering mechanism for audio input
   - Add noise cancellation and audio preprocessing capabilities
   - Create event-based system for voice activity detection
   - Implement thread-safe access to microphone resources

3. Refactor speaker output implementation:
   - Move speaker initialization and playback code to VoiceService
   - Create audio output queue with priority levels
   - Implement volume control and audio mixing capabilities
   - Add support for different audio formats and codecs
   - Ensure proper resource cleanup when audio is not in use

4. Integrate with ServiceManager:
   - Register VoiceService with the application's ServiceManager
   - Implement proper lifecycle hooks (initialize, start, pause, resume, stop)
   - Add configuration loading from application settings
   - Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms

5. Update existing voice I/O consumers:
   - Refactor code that directly accesses microphone/speaker to use VoiceService
   - Update any voice processing components to work with the new abstraction
   - Ensure backward compatibility during transition period
   - Document new API for team members

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure startup performance improvement:
   - Compare application startup time before and after implementation
   - Verify that audio-related components are not loaded until needed
   - Profile memory usage during startup with and without lazy loading
   - Measure time to first audio input/output with cold vs. warm service

2. Test audio input functionality:
   - Verify microphone initialization occurs only on first use
   - Test recording quality across different microphone configurations
   - Measure latency between physical audio and captured samples
   - Verify proper resource cleanup when microphone is not in use
   - Test concurrent access patterns to ensure thread safety

3. Test audio output functionality:
   - Verify speaker initialization occurs only on first use
   - Test playback quality across different output devices
   - Measure latency between playback request and actual audio output
   - Verify audio mixing works correctly with multiple simultaneous sources
   - Test volume control and audio format conversion

4. Integration testing:
   - Verify all existing voice-dependent features work with the new service
   - Test interaction with other services (especially any that might use audio)
   - Verify proper error handling when audio devices are unavailable
   - Test service behavior during application suspend/resume cycles

5. Performance testing:
   - Measure CPU and memory usage during active audio operations
   - Test behavior under high load (continuous recording/playback)
   - Verify no memory leaks during extended usage periods
