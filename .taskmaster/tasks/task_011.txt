# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop systems to ensure the application meets the technical and performance benchmarks specified in the PRD, including response latency, voice reliability, and stability.
# Details:
1. Create PerformanceMonitor class with methods:
   - track_response_time(start, end, query_type)
   - monitor_memory_usage()
   - track_voice_reliability(success, failure)
   - log_performance_metrics()
2. Implement performance dashboards in UI
3. Create automated performance testing suite
4. Implement memory leak detection
5. Add GPU utilization monitoring
6. Create performance profiling tools
7. Implement automatic optimization suggestions
8. Add crash recovery mechanisms
9. Create detailed performance logging

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify response times meet requirements (<2s for Talker)
2. Test voice interface reliability (target: 99%)
3. Run extended stability tests (24+ hours)
4. Measure memory usage over time to detect leaks
5. Test crash recovery functionality
6. Validate performance logging accuracy
