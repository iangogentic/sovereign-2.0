# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Intelligent Orchestration System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the orchestration logic that manages the handoff between the 'Talker' and 'Thinker' models, ensuring seamless integration and appropriate model selection based on query complexity.
# Details:
1. Implement ModelOrchestrator class with methods:
   - process_query(user_input, context)
   - determine_complexity(query, context)
   - handle_model_handoff(query, context)
   - integrate_responses(thinker_response)
2. Create advanced complexity detection algorithm with 4 levels (Simple, Moderate, Complex, Very Complex):
   - Comprehensive regex patterns for different query types
   - Context-aware complexity scoring with confidence levels
   - Smart model selection logic based on complexity and context
3. Implement intelligent response caching system:
   - Caching based on query complexity and response quality
   - Cache expiration with configurable TTL (default 24 hours)
   - Automatic cache cleaning when max size reached
   - Query hashing for consistent cache keys
4. Develop advanced handoff logic:
   - Uncertainty detection in Talker responses
   - Short response detection for complex queries
   - Keyword-based handoff triggers
   - Context-aware handoff decisions
   - Response integration from both models
5. Implement comprehensive telemetry system:
   - Query statistics tracking (total, by model, handoffs)
   - Performance metrics (response times, cache hit rates)
   - Error tracking and uptime monitoring
   - Complexity distribution analysis
   - Real-time status reporting
6. Create OrchestratorConfig class in config.py:
   - Configurable thresholds and settings
   - Cache and telemetry configuration options
   - Handoff confidence settings
7. Integrate with CLI:
   - Full orchestrator integration
   - New --test-orchestrator command
   - Enhanced status, stats, and cache commands
   - Debug mode with detailed query information
   - Session context management

# Test Strategy:
1. Test accuracy of complexity detection algorithm across all 4 complexity levels
2. Measure end-to-end response time including handoffs
3. Verify context preservation during model switching
4. Test with various query types to ensure appropriate model selection
5. Validate graceful handling of edge cases and failures
6. Test caching system functionality and performance
7. Verify telemetry data collection and reporting
8. Test CLI integration and commands
9. Validate configuration system and settings
10. Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
