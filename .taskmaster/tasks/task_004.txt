# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Intelligent Orchestration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the orchestration logic that manages the handoff between the 'Talker' and 'Thinker' models, ensuring seamless integration and appropriate model selection based on query complexity.
# Details:
1. Implement ModelOrchestrator class with methods:
   - process_query(user_input, context)
   - determine_complexity(query, context)
   - handle_model_handoff(query, context)
   - integrate_responses(thinker_response)
2. Create complexity detection algorithm using:
   - Keyword/pattern matching for known complex queries
   - Heuristics for identifying multi-step reasoning needs
   - Token count and query structure analysis
3. Implement context preservation during handoffs
4. Add user notification system for model switching
5. Create fallback mechanisms if either model fails
6. Implement response caching for similar queries
7. Add telemetry for orchestration decisions (local only)

# Test Strategy:
1. Test accuracy of complexity detection algorithm
2. Measure end-to-end response time including handoffs
3. Verify context preservation during model switching
4. Test with various query types to ensure appropriate model selection
5. Validate graceful handling of edge cases and failures
