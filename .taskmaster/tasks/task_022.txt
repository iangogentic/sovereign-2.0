# Task ID: 22
# Title: Migrate Tools to an On-Demand ToolService
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Encapsulate tool discovery and execution in a dedicated ToolService that implements lazy loading, initializing tools only when requested to improve startup performance and modularize the application architecture.
# Details:
1. Create a new ToolService class:
   - Implement singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists
   - Design a tool registry to track available tools and their metadata
   - Implement lazy loading mechanism that initializes tools only on first request
   - Add configuration options for tool loading priorities and dependencies
   - Create interfaces for tool discovery, registration, and execution

2. Implement tool discovery mechanism:
   - Create a plugin-like architecture for tool registration
   - Support automatic discovery of tools in designated directories
   - Implement tool metadata extraction for capabilities and requirements
   - Add versioning support for tools to manage compatibility

3. Develop tool execution framework:
   - Create standardized interfaces for tool invocation
   - Implement parameter validation and type checking
   - Add error handling and graceful degradation when tools fail
   - Support both synchronous and asynchronous tool execution
   - Implement tool execution logging and performance metrics

4. Refactor existing tool implementations:
   - Move direct tool instantiation code to the ToolService
   - Update tool imports to use the service's lazy loading mechanism
   - Implement proxy methods that route to the actual tool implementations
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing tool usage patterns

5. Add tool lifecycle management:
   - Implement proper initialization and cleanup for tools
   - Add resource management to prevent memory leaks
   - Support tool reloading without application restart
   - Implement tool dependency resolution for tools that require other tools

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure startup performance improvement:
   - Compare application startup time before and after implementation
   - Verify that tool-related components are not loaded until needed
   - Profile memory usage during startup with and without lazy loading
   - Measure time to first tool execution with cold vs. warm starts

2. Test tool discovery mechanism:
   - Verify all existing tools are properly discovered and registered
   - Test discovery of new tools added at runtime
   - Validate correct metadata extraction from tool implementations
   - Test edge cases like duplicate tools or incompatible versions

3. Validate tool execution framework:
   - Create unit tests for each tool execution path
   - Test parameter validation with valid and invalid inputs
   - Verify error handling correctly captures and reports failures
   - Test asynchronous tool execution with various completion times
   - Measure performance overhead of the service layer

4. Integration testing:
   - Verify all application features that use tools continue to function
   - Test interactions between multiple tools in sequence
   - Validate that tool dependencies are correctly resolved
   - Test the system under high load with multiple concurrent tool requests

5. Regression testing:
   - Ensure existing functionality remains intact
   - Verify no performance degradation for critical tool operations
   - Test backward compatibility with code that might bypass the service
