# Task ID: 15
# Title: Configure and Document Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and document the Python virtual environment with proper CUDA-compatible PyTorch installation sequence to ensure consistent GPU acceleration across development machines.
# Details:
1. Create detailed documentation for setting up the development environment:
   - Python version requirements (3.10+)
   - Required system dependencies (CUDA toolkit version, cuDNN)
   - GPU hardware requirements and driver versions

2. Document the critical installation sequence:
   - Create Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
   - Install CUDA-compatible PyTorch first: `pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`
   - Install remaining dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Verify GPU acceleration with test script:
```python
import torch
print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"CUDA device count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"CUDA device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
```

3. Create troubleshooting guide for common issues:
   - CUDA version mismatch between PyTorch and system
   - GPU not detected by PyTorch
   - CUDA out of memory errors
   - cuDNN not found
   - Common error messages and their solutions

4. Create a setup script (`setup_env.py` or `setup_env.sh`) that:
   - Checks system requirements
   - Creates virtual environment
   - Installs dependencies in the correct order
   - Verifies the installation

5. Document environment variables needed:
   - CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
   - PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
   - Other relevant environment variables

6. Create a development environment validation script that tests:
   - Model loading capabilities
   - Basic inference on GPU
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Performance benchmarking

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the environment setup process on multiple machines with different GPU configurations:
   - NVIDIA consumer GPUs (RTX series)
   - NVIDIA professional GPUs (if available)
   - Systems with multiple GPUs
   - Systems with minimum required specifications

2. Verify GPU acceleration works correctly:
   - Run the validation script to confirm PyTorch detects CUDA
   - Perform a simple model inference test and verify it uses GPU
   - Check memory allocation on GPU during inference
   - Compare inference speed between CPU and GPU to confirm acceleration

3. Test the troubleshooting guide:
   - Deliberately create common error scenarios
   - Follow the troubleshooting steps to resolve them
   - Update guide with any additional issues encountered

4. Validate the setup script:
   - Test on a clean system without any dependencies
   - Verify it correctly installs all components in the right order
   - Confirm the validation checks work as expected

5. Test environment consistency:
   - Have multiple team members follow the documentation to set up their environments
   - Compare environment configurations to ensure consistency
   - Verify all developers can run the application with GPU acceleration

6. Document any hardware-specific configurations or issues encountered during testing
