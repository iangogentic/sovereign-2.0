# Task ID: 20
# Title: Migrate Models to a Lazy-Loaded ModelService
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 16, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the application to wrap Talker/Thinker models in a ModelService that implements lazy loading, initializing models only on first use to improve startup performance.
# Details:
1. Create a new ModelService class:
   - Implement a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists
   - Add model registry to track available models
   - Implement lazy loading mechanism that initializes models only on first request
   - Add configuration options for model loading priorities

2. Refactor Talker/Thinker model initialization:
   - Move model initialization code from direct instantiation to ModelService
   - Implement proxy methods that route to the actual model implementations
   - Add model state tracking (unloaded, loading, ready, error)
   - Implement proper resource cleanup for models when they're no longer needed

3. Update model access patterns throughout the application:
   - Replace direct Talker/Thinker instantiation with ModelService.get_talker() and ModelService.get_thinker()
   - Add model status callbacks for UI to show loading progress
   - Implement model preloading option for frequently used models

4. Optimize memory management:
   - Add configurable model unloading for inactive models
   - Implement memory usage monitoring
   - Add prioritization system for model loading/unloading based on usage patterns

5. Handle error conditions:
   - Implement graceful fallbacks when model loading fails
   - Add detailed error reporting for model initialization issues
   - Create recovery mechanisms for transient failures

6. Update ServiceManager integration:
   - Register ModelService with the ServiceManager
   - Ensure proper lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown)
   - Implement service dependencies correctly

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure startup performance improvement:
   - Compare application startup time before and after implementation
   - Verify that cold start launches in under 1 second
   - Profile memory usage during startup with and without lazy loading

2. Test model loading behavior:
   - Verify models are only loaded on first use
   - Measure time to first response for each model type
   - Test concurrent model loading scenarios
   - Verify proper error handling when model loading fails

3. Validate memory management:
   - Monitor memory usage during extended application use
   - Test model unloading functionality
   - Verify resources are properly released when models are unloaded

4. Integration testing:
   - Ensure all application features using models continue to work correctly
   - Test transitions between different models
   - Verify UI correctly displays model loading states

5. Regression testing:
   - Verify all existing model functionality works with the new ModelService
   - Test with various model configurations and sizes
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

6. Performance testing:
   - Measure impact on inference speed
   - Test under low memory conditions
   - Verify behavior with multiple models loaded simultaneously
