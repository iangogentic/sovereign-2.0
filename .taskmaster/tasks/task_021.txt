# Task ID: 21
# Title: Migrate RAG to an On-Demand MemoryService
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the application to move FAISS vector database and MemoryManager into a dedicated MemoryService that initializes on first query, improving startup performance and memory management.
# Details:
1. Create a new MemoryService class:
   - Implement singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists
   - Design interface for vector storage and retrieval operations
   - Implement lazy loading mechanism that initializes FAISS only on first query
   - Add configuration options for memory persistence and vector dimensions

2. Migrate existing FAISS implementation:
   - Move vector database initialization from direct instantiation to MemoryService
   - Refactor index creation and management to be handled by the service
   - Implement proper cleanup and resource management for FAISS indexes
   - Add support for multiple vector stores with different configurations

3. Refactor MemoryManager integration:
   - Update MemoryManager to use MemoryService for storage operations
   - Implement proxy methods that route to the actual vector store implementation
   - Ensure thread-safety for concurrent memory operations
   - Add caching layer to optimize frequent retrieval operations

4. Optimize RAG performance:
   - Implement batched vector operations to reduce overhead
   - Add configurable similarity thresholds for retrieval
   - Create index persistence mechanism to avoid rebuilding on restart
   - Implement memory usage monitoring and optimization

5. Update dependent components:
   - Modify any components that directly accessed FAISS to use MemoryService
   - Update query processing pipeline to work with the new service
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure startup performance improvement:
   - Compare application startup time before and after implementation
   - Verify that memory-intensive components are not loaded until needed
   - Profile memory usage during startup with and without lazy loading
   - Measure time to first query with cold vs. warm starts

2. Test vector storage and retrieval functionality:
   - Create unit tests for all MemoryService public methods
   - Verify vector embeddings are correctly stored and retrieved
   - Test with various vector dimensions and index sizes
   - Benchmark retrieval performance with different query patterns

3. Validate integration with existing components:
   - Ensure RAG functionality works correctly with the new service
   - Test concurrent query scenarios to verify thread safety
   - Verify all dependent components can access memory services properly
   - Test error handling and recovery scenarios

4. Performance testing:
   - Measure memory footprint before and after implementation
   - Test with large vector databases to ensure scalability
   - Verify query latency remains within acceptable thresholds
   - Test memory cleanup and resource management
