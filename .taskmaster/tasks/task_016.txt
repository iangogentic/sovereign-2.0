# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Robust Debugging and Testing Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive debugging and testing framework to address critical integration bugs between the GUI and backend orchestrator, with enhanced logging, error handling, and integration tests.
# Details:
1. Fix the QueryContext initialization bug in GUI worker thread:
   - Fixed TypeError: QueryContext.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'query'
   - Root cause: GUI worker thread was passing 'query' instead of required 'user_input' parameter
   - Solution: Updated GUI process_request_thread() to use correct QueryContext constructor arguments

2. Implement enhanced debug logging system:
   - Created get_debug_logger() in logger.py with dedicated debug logging infrastructure
   - Implemented file-based logging with automatic debug log files in logs/debug_YYYYMMDD.log
   - Added full exception stack trace logging with traceback module integration
   - Integrated debug logger with GUI worker thread for detailed request processing logs
   - Implemented enhanced error handling with comprehensive try-catch around orchestrator.process_query()

3. Develop integration test framework:
   - Created tests/test_integration.py with 8 test cases covering full GUI-backend integration
   - Implemented QueryContext validation tests to verify correct parameter usage
   - Added thread communication tests to validate queue-based communication
   - Created error handling tests to verify proper error capture and logging
   - Implemented full workflow testing with simulation of GUI message sending to backend
   - Added debug framework testing to validate logger creation and traceback capture

4. Establish robust error handling infrastructure:
   - Implemented comprehensive try-catch blocks with detailed error logging
   - Added proper error propagation between components
   - Enhanced error reporting with full context capture
   - Integrated error handling with debug logging system

5. Implement debugging tools:
   - Added debug logging infrastructure with configurable verbosity
   - Implemented traceback capture for comprehensive error analysis
   - Created integration testing framework for rapid issue identification
   - Established error handling patterns for consistent debugging

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify QueryContext initialization fix:
   - Confirmed fix for TypeError: QueryContext.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'query'
   - Validated correct parameter passing between GUI and backend
   - Verified thread safety in multi-threaded environment

2. Test enhanced logging system:
   - Verified get_debug_logger() creates properly configured loggers
   - Validated log file creation and formatting in logs/debug_YYYYMMDD.log
   - Tested exception handling with full traceback capture
   - Confirmed integration with GUI worker thread logging

3. Validate integration test framework:
   - Executed all 8 integration tests with 100% pass rate
   - Verified tests catch parameter mismatches and regression bugs
   - Confirmed tests validate thread communication correctly
   - Validated error handling tests properly capture and log errors

4. Test error handling infrastructure:
   - Verified comprehensive try-catch blocks capture all exceptions
   - Validated error logging includes full context and tracebacks
   - Confirmed proper error propagation between components
   - Tested integration with debug logging system

5. Verify debugging tools:
   - Confirmed debug logging infrastructure works with configurable verbosity
   - Validated traceback capture provides comprehensive error analysis
   - Verified integration testing framework identifies issues rapidly
   - Tested error handling patterns for consistent debugging experience
