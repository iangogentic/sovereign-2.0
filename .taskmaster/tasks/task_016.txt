# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Robust Debugging and Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive debugging and testing framework to address critical integration bugs between the GUI and backend orchestrator, with enhanced logging, error handling, and integration tests.
# Details:
1. Fix the QueryContext initialization bug in GUI worker thread:
   - Identify race conditions in the initialization process
   - Implement proper synchronization mechanisms
   - Ensure thread-safe access to shared resources

2. Implement enhanced debug logging system:
   - Create a LoggingManager class with methods:
     - configure_logging(log_level, log_path)
     - log_error(message, exception, traceback)
     - log_warning(message)
     - log_info(message)
     - log_debug(message)
   - Implement full traceback capture for all exceptions
   - Add contextual information to log entries (timestamp, thread ID, component)
   - Create rotating log files with configurable retention

3. Develop integration test framework:
   - Create IntegrationTestRunner class
   - Implement test cases for GUI-backend communication:
     - Model selection and handoff tests
     - Response streaming tests
     - Error propagation tests
     - Context preservation tests
   - Add mock components for isolated testing
   - Implement automated test execution

4. Establish robust error handling infrastructure:
   - Create standardized error types for different components
   - Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
   - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions
   - Implement automatic error reporting (with user consent)
   - Create error recovery mechanisms where possible

5. Implement debugging tools:
   - Add debug mode toggle in settings
   - Create debug visualization for model orchestration
   - Implement performance profiling for critical paths
   - Add component state inspection capabilities

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify QueryContext initialization fix:
   - Create stress test with multiple concurrent queries
   - Validate thread safety under high load
   - Verify no deadlocks or race conditions occur

2. Test enhanced logging system:
   - Verify log rotation works correctly
   - Validate all log levels function as expected
   - Test exception handling captures full tracebacks
   - Verify log file format and readability

3. Validate integration test framework:
   - Run all integration tests and verify pass/fail reporting
   - Test with intentionally broken components to verify detection
   - Measure test coverage of critical paths
   - Verify mock components accurately simulate real behavior

4. Test error handling infrastructure:
   - Simulate various error conditions and verify proper handling
   - Test user-facing error messages for clarity
   - Verify error recovery mechanisms function correctly
   - Test error reporting system (with consent)

5. Verify debugging tools:
   - Test debug mode functionality
   - Validate visualization accuracy
   - Measure performance impact of debug features
   - Test component state inspection for accuracy
