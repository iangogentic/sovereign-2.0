# Task ID: 19
# Title: Establish Core Application Shell & Service Manager
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 8, 10, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main application entry point (main.py), implement the CoreApp class, and develop a placeholder ServiceManager that enables cold launch in under 1 second.
# Details:
1. Create main.py as the application entry point:
   - Implement command-line argument parsing
   - Configure logging initialization
   - Handle environment setup and configuration loading
   - Initialize the CoreApp instance
   - Add graceful shutdown handling

2. Implement CoreApp class:
   - Create a modular application core that initializes only essential services on startup
   - Implement lazy loading pattern for non-critical services
   - Add application lifecycle management (init, start, stop, pause, resume)
   - Create event system for inter-service communication
   - Implement configuration management and persistence
   - Add performance monitoring for startup sequence

3. Develop ServiceManager class:
   - Create service registration and discovery mechanism
   - Implement service dependency resolution
   - Add service lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
   - Create service health monitoring
   - Implement prioritized initialization for critical services
   - Add dynamic service loading/unloading capabilities
   - Create service configuration interface

4. Optimize cold launch performance:
   - Implement startup profiling to identify bottlenecks
   - Use asynchronous initialization for non-critical services
   - Create a startup sequence that prioritizes UI responsiveness
   - Implement resource usage throttling during startup
   - Add progress reporting for long-running initialization tasks
   - Create a minimal viable state for initial user interaction

5. Integrate with existing components:
   - Connect to ModelOrchestrator (Task 4)
   - Interface with UI components (Task 10)
   - Integrate with ToolIntegrationFramework (Task 8)
   - Ensure compatibility with debugging framework (Task 16)

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure cold launch performance:
   - Create automated test to measure time from application launch to interactive UI
   - Verify cold launch completes in under 1 second on target hardware
   - Profile memory usage during startup sequence
   - Test launch performance under different system loads

2. Verify CoreApp functionality:
   - Test application lifecycle methods (init, start, stop, pause, resume)
   - Verify configuration loading and persistence
   - Test event system with multiple subscribers
   - Validate graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
   - Test error handling during initialization failures

3. Test ServiceManager capabilities:
   - Verify service registration and discovery mechanism
   - Test service dependency resolution with complex dependency graphs
   - Validate service lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
   - Test dynamic service loading/unloading
   - Verify service health monitoring and reporting

4. Integration testing:
   - Verify correct integration with ModelOrchestrator
   - Test UI responsiveness during startup
   - Validate tool framework integration
   - Test with debugging framework enabled
   - Verify all critical services are properly initialized

5. Edge case testing:
   - Test application behavior with missing or corrupted configuration
   - Verify recovery from service initialization failures
   - Test performance on minimum specification hardware
   - Validate behavior when system resources are constrained
