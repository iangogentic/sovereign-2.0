# Task ID: 17
# Title: Diagnose and Fix CUDA GPU Fallback Issue
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 2, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify and resolve the critical hardware issue causing the application to fall back to CPU instead of utilizing CUDA GPU acceleration, which severely impacts AI model performance.
# Details:
1. Implement comprehensive GPU diagnostics system:
   - Create a GPUDiagnosticTool class with methods:
     - check_cuda_availability()
     - verify_gpu_drivers()
     - test_pytorch_cuda_compatibility()
     - measure_gpu_performance()
     - log_system_configuration()
   - Add detailed error reporting with specific CUDA error codes and descriptions

2. Identify potential root causes:
   - Check CUDA toolkit version compatibility with PyTorch installation
   - Verify GPU driver versions against requirements
   - Inspect model loading code for missing CUDA device assignment
   - Check for memory leaks causing GPU OOM errors
   - Analyze CUDA initialization sequence in ThinkerModel and TalkerModel classes
   - Verify correct CUDA device selection when multiple GPUs are present

3. Implement fixes for common CUDA issues:
   - Add explicit device assignment in model loading: `model.to('cuda')`
   - Implement proper CUDA memory management with `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
   - Add graceful fallback with warning when GPU is unavailable
   - Fix any incorrect tensor device assignments
   - Ensure proper CUDA stream management for concurrent operations

4. Add GPU monitoring and automatic recovery:
   - Implement continuous GPU health monitoring
   - Add automatic model reloading on CUDA errors
   - Create user notification system for GPU issues
   - Implement configurable fallback thresholds

5. Update model initialization code:
   - Modify ThinkerModel and TalkerModel to explicitly check and use CUDA
   - Add detailed logging during model initialization
   - Implement proper error handling for CUDA initialization failures

6. Optimize CUDA memory usage:
   - Implement gradient checkpointing for large models
   - Add configurable precision settings (FP16/BF16)
   - Implement efficient tensor management to reduce fragmentation

7. Root cause identified and fix implementation:
   - CRITICAL ISSUE: CPU-only PyTorch installation (2.7.1+cpu) despite functional GPU hardware
   - Hardware verification results:
     - RTX 5070 Ti (16GB VRAM) detected and operational
     - NVIDIA drivers 576.57 installed correctly
     - CUDA 12.9 toolkit properly installed
     - nvidia-smi functioning as expected
   - Implementation solution:
     - Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support using:
       `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`
     - Verify installation with torch.cuda.is_available() check
     - Update requirements.txt to specify CUDA-enabled PyTorch version

8. Enhanced diagnostic capabilities:
   - Added diagnose_gpu_environment() function to hardware.py
   - Implemented --diagnose-gpu command-line argument in run_sovereign.py
   - Created 8-step comprehensive diagnostic process covering:
     - PyTorch version verification
     - CUDA availability checking
     - Driver compatibility testing
     - Environment variable validation
     - Specific recommendation generation based on detected issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify CUDA detection and initialization:
   - Run diagnostic tool on systems with known working CUDA setup
   - Test on systems with different GPU configurations
   - Verify correct detection of CUDA capabilities

2. Measure performance before and after fixes:
   - Benchmark inference speed on standard prompts
   - Compare memory usage patterns
   - Measure model loading times
   - Quantify performance difference between CPU and GPU operation

3. Test error handling and recovery:
   - Simulate GPU errors by intentionally corrupting CUDA state
   - Verify application can recover from CUDA initialization failures
   - Test graceful degradation to CPU when necessary

4. Validate fixes across different environments:
   - Test on multiple NVIDIA GPU generations
   - Verify compatibility with different CUDA toolkit versions
   - Test with various PyTorch versions

5. Regression testing:
   - Ensure all models (Talker and Thinker) still function correctly
   - Verify no new memory leaks are introduced
   - Confirm all existing functionality works with GPU acceleration

6. Long-running stability test:
   - Run continuous inference operations for 24+ hours
   - Monitor for memory leaks or performance degradation
   - Verify consistent GPU utilization over time
