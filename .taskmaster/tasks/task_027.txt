# Task ID: 27
# Title: Design and Implement Feature Access Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a slash command system in CoreApp interactive loop to provide clear access paths to advanced features (RAG/memory, tools, screen context) identified as missing during UAT testing.
# Details:
1. Design the slash command architecture:
   - Create a SlashCommandManager class to handle registration and execution of commands
   - Define a standard interface for slash commands with methods:
     ```python
     class SlashCommand:
         def get_name(self) -> str: ...
         def get_description(self) -> str: ...
         def get_usage(self) -> str: ...
         def execute(self, args: str, context: QueryContext) -> str: ...
     ```
   - Implement command discovery and registration mechanism

2. Implement core slash commands:
   - `/help` - Display available commands and their descriptions
   - `/memory` - Access and manage RAG system (search, clear, export)
   - `/tools` - List available tools and execute them directly
   - `/screen` - Toggle screen context capture and display current context
   - `/model` - Switch between Talker/Thinker models or external models
   - `/config` - View and modify application configuration
   - `/debug` - Toggle debug mode and access diagnostic information

3. Integrate with CoreApp interactive loop:
   - Modify the input processing in CoreApp.run() to detect and route slash commands
   - Add code to CoreApp to initialize the SlashCommandManager
   - Implement slash command parsing logic:
     ```python
     def process_input(self, user_input: str):
         if user_input.startswith('/'):
             command_parts = user_input[1:].split(' ', 1)
             command_name = command_parts[0]
             args = command_parts[1] if len(command_parts) > 1 else ""
             return self.slash_command_manager.execute_command(command_name, args, self.context)
         else:
             # Process as normal query
             return self.model_service.process_query(user_input, self.context)
     ```

4. Connect slash commands to services:
   - Link `/memory` commands to MemoryService
   - Link `/tools` commands to ToolService
   - Link `/screen` commands to ScreenContextService
   - Link `/model` commands to ModelService

5. Implement help system and documentation:
   - Create detailed help text for each command
   - Implement contextual help that shows relevant commands
   - Add examples for each command in the help documentation

6. Add command history and tab completion:
   - Implement command history tracking
   - Add tab completion for command names and arguments
   - Create context-aware suggestions based on partial commands

7. Implement error handling and feedback:
   - Create clear error messages for invalid commands
   - Add confirmation for destructive operations
   - Implement verbose mode for detailed command output

# Test Strategy:
1. Test slash command parsing and routing:
   - Verify that inputs starting with '/' are correctly identified as commands
   - Test command parsing with various argument formats
   - Verify that non-command inputs are processed normally
   - Test error handling for malformed commands

2. Test each core slash command:
   - Verify `/help` displays all available commands
   - Test `/memory` operations (search, clear, export)
   - Verify `/tools` correctly lists and executes available tools
   - Test `/screen` toggle functionality
   - Verify `/model` switching between different models
   - Test `/config` view and modification capabilities
   - Verify `/debug` toggle and information display

3. Test integration with services:
   - Verify commands correctly interact with MemoryService
   - Test tool execution through ToolService
   - Verify screen context commands work with ScreenContextService
   - Test model switching through ModelService

4. Test help system:
   - Verify help text is displayed for each command
   - Test contextual help functionality
   - Verify examples are clear and accurate

5. Test command history and completion:
   - Verify command history is correctly tracked
   - Test tab completion for command names
   - Verify argument completion works as expected

6. Perform user acceptance testing:
   - Have test users attempt to access features using slash commands
   - Collect feedback on command discoverability and usability
   - Verify that slash commands provide clear access to previously hard-to-find features

7. Test error handling:
   - Verify appropriate error messages for invalid commands
   - Test confirmation prompts for destructive operations
   - Verify verbose mode provides useful additional information
