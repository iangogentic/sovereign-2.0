# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Architecture and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational project structure and development environment for the Sovereign AI Agent, ensuring all dependencies are properly configured for local execution.
# Details:
1. Initialize a new Python project with proper directory structure
2. Set up virtual environment with Python 3.10+
3. Create requirements.txt with essential dependencies:
   - PyTorch with CUDA support
   - Transformers library for model loading
   - FastAPI for potential API endpoints
   - SQLite for local storage
   - Necessary GPU acceleration libraries
4. Configure GPU detection and optimization settings
5. Create configuration files for environment variables
6. Implement logging system
7. Setup basic CLI entry point with single-command launch capability
8. Document system requirements (NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti 16GB or equivalent)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify environment setup on target hardware
2. Test GPU detection and CUDA availability
3. Validate that all dependencies install correctly
4. Ensure the application launches with a single command
5. Verify logging system captures appropriate information
