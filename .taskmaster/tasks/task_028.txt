# Task ID: 28
# Title: Formalize Development Environment Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 17, 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive development environment documentation and automation to ensure consistent, stable setups across all development machines with focus on PyTorch CUDA 12.1 compatibility.
# Details:
1. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed environment setup instructions:
   - Document Python version requirements (3.10+)
   - Specify exact CUDA toolkit version (12.1) and compatible driver requirements
   - Document step-by-step virtual environment creation process
   - List all dependencies with specific version pinning for stability
   - Include troubleshooting section for common setup issues

2. Develop Windows batch script (setup_dev_env.bat) for automated environment setup:
   - Check for Python installation and version
   - Create and activate virtual environment
   - Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support using the correct installation command:
     ```
     pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
     ```
   - Install all other dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Verify CUDA availability with a simple PyTorch test script
   - Generate a report of the installed environment

3. Create equivalent shell script (setup_dev_env.sh) for Linux/macOS:
   - Implement the same functionality as the Windows batch script
   - Add appropriate error handling and progress indicators
   - Include GPU detection and compatibility checks

4. Update README.md with development setup guidance:
   - Add a "Development Setup" section with quick start instructions
   - Link to CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed instructions
   - Document manual and automated setup options
   - Include verification steps to confirm proper environment setup

5. Create environment validation script (validate_env.py):
   - Check Python version
   - Verify PyTorch installation with correct CUDA support
   - Test GPU detection and basic operations
   - Validate all required dependencies are installed
   - Generate a report of any issues found

6. Document specific version requirements in a requirements-dev.txt file:
   - Pin PyTorch to version compatible with CUDA 12.1
   - Specify exact versions for all dependencies to ensure consistency
   - Include development-only dependencies (testing frameworks, linters, etc.)

7. Add CI configuration to validate environment setup:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow to test environment setup scripts
   - Verify scripts work on Windows, Linux, and macOS
   - Test with different GPU configurations when possible

# Test Strategy:
1. Test automated setup scripts on multiple clean environments:
   - Test on Windows 10/11 with different NVIDIA GPU configurations
   - Test on Ubuntu Linux with compatible NVIDIA GPUs
   - Test on macOS (for CPU-only operation)
   - Verify scripts handle pre-existing installations gracefully

2. Validate PyTorch CUDA compatibility:
   - Run the validation script to confirm PyTorch can access CUDA
   - Execute a simple tensor operation on GPU and measure performance
   - Verify correct CUDA version (12.1) is detected by PyTorch
   - Test with both consumer (RTX) and professional NVIDIA GPUs

3. Perform user testing of documentation:
   - Have team members follow the documentation on clean machines
   - Collect feedback on clarity and completeness
   - Identify and document any edge cases or system-specific issues
   - Update documentation based on feedback

4. Verify consistency across development environments:
   - Compare package versions across different setups
   - Run the application's test suite on different environments
   - Ensure model loading and inference work identically
   - Measure and compare performance metrics

5. Test error handling and troubleshooting guidance:
   - Simulate common error conditions (missing CUDA, incompatible drivers)
   - Verify error messages are clear and actionable
   - Test the troubleshooting steps in the documentation
   - Ensure validation script correctly identifies and reports issues
