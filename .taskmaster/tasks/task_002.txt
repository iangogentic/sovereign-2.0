# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement 'Talker' Model Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the fast, local conversational model (Gemma2:9b) via Ollama to serve as the primary interface for user interactions, ensuring responses are generated in under 2 seconds.
# Details:
1. Implement an OllamaClient class to handle communication with the Ollama server at http://localhost:11434
2. Create a TalkerModel class that uses the OllamaClient to make API calls to the /api/generate endpoint
3. Implement response generation:
   - generate_response method should send the prompt to Ollama and return the streamed response
   - detect_complex_query(prompt, context)
4. Add configuration in config.py for the Ollama model name (e.g., 'gemma2:9b') and the API endpoint
5. Implement response time tracking to ensure sub-2-second goal
6. Implement proper error handling for Ollama server connectivity
7. Add graceful fallback if Ollama is not running or model is not available

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure response times for standard queries (target: <2 seconds)
2. Test with various prompt lengths and complexities
3. Verify connectivity with Ollama server
4. Test error handling when Ollama server is unavailable
5. Validate quality of responses against baseline expectations
6. Test streaming response functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement OllamaClient class [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created a full async HTTP client using aiohttp in src/sovereign/ollama_client.py with health checking, model listing, pulling capabilities, streaming and non-streaming text generation, comprehensive error handling with custom OllamaError exception, and proper session management and cleanup.
### Details:


## 2. Implement TalkerModel class [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Created TalkerModel in src/sovereign/talker_model.py as the primary interface for fast conversational AI via Ollama, with automatic initialization, health checks, model verification, sub-2-second response generation, intelligent complexity detection using regex patterns, performance tracking, and proper system prompt for Sovereign personality.
### Details:


## 3. Update configuration [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Updated src/sovereign/config.py with Ollama-specific settings (endpoint, temperature, top_p, streaming) and updated model names to use Ollama models (gemma2:9b, deepseek-r1:14b).
### Details:


## 4. Integrate with CLI [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Updated src/sovereign/cli.py to add --test-talker command, use TalkerModel instead of echo responses in the interactive loop, implement real-time complexity detection with handoff messaging, and add performance statistics command.
### Details:


## 5. Add dependencies and testing [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Added aiohttp to requirements.txt and created a comprehensive test suite with 14 tests (12 passing) covering initialization, complexity detection, performance stats, and error handling. Tests confirm Ollama integration works correctly.
### Details:


## 6. Implement performance features [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Added response time tracking with target of <2 seconds, automatic complexity detection for Thinker model handoff, graceful error handling and fallback messages, and performance statistics and monitoring.
### Details:


## 7. Fix remaining test failures [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Address the 2 failing tests identified during implementation to achieve 100% test passing rate.
