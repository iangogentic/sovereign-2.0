# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Voice Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the complete voice interface including speech recognition, text-to-speech output, voice activity detection, and wake word activation for hands-free operation.
# Details:
1. Create VoiceInterfaceManager class with methods:
   - initialize(config)
   - start_listening()
   - process_audio(audio_chunk)
   - detect_wake_word(audio)
   - transcribe_speech(audio)
   - synthesize_speech(text)
2. Integrate high-quality speech-to-text engine (e.g., Whisper local model)
3. Implement text-to-speech system with natural voice (e.g., VITS or similar local model)
4. Develop Voice Activity Detection using efficient local algorithm
5. Implement wake word detection ("Hey Sovereign") using lightweight local model
6. Create audio input/output handling with proper device selection
7. Add voice profile customization options
8. Implement background noise filtering
9. Create visual indicators for voice system status

# Test Strategy:
1. Test speech recognition accuracy in various environments
2. Measure wake word detection reliability (target: 99%)
3. Test voice activity detection accuracy
4. Evaluate text-to-speech naturalness and clarity
5. Measure latency of full voice interaction loop
6. Test in noisy environments
7. Verify proper device handling across different audio setups
