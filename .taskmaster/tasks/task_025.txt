# Task ID: 25
# Title: Final System Integration & Re-Verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Wire all services together via ServiceManager, perform comprehensive system integration, run the full test suite, and update documentation to ensure the Sovereign AI Agent functions as a cohesive system.
# Details:
1. Create a ServiceManager class to coordinate all services:
   - Implement singleton pattern with methods to access all services
   - Add service_registry to track and manage service instances
   - Implement dependency resolution between services
   - Add configuration for service startup priorities
   - Create unified error handling and logging across services

2. Wire together all service components:
   - Connect ModelService (Task 20) to handle model orchestration
   - Integrate VoiceService (Task 24) for audio input/output
   - Link ScreenContextService (Task 23) for visual context awareness
   - Connect MemoryService (Task 21) for knowledge persistence
   - Integrate ToolService (Task 22) for external capabilities

3. Implement system-wide configuration:
   - Create unified configuration system for all services
   - Add environment-specific configuration profiles
   - Implement configuration validation

4. Develop comprehensive integration tests:
   - Create test scenarios covering all service interactions
   - Implement end-to-end workflow tests
   - Test failure recovery and graceful degradation

5. Update documentation:
   - Update architecture diagrams to reflect service-based design
   - Create service interaction documentation
   - Update API documentation for all services
   - Create deployment and configuration guides
   - Update developer onboarding documentation

6. Performance optimization:
   - Identify and resolve any performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize inter-service communication
   - Implement performance monitoring across services
   - Verify system meets all PRD performance requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Run comprehensive integration test suite:
   - Verify all services initialize correctly
   - Test service interactions under normal conditions
   - Test service interactions under error conditions
   - Verify lazy loading behavior works correctly across services

2. Perform end-to-end testing:
   - Test complete user workflows from voice input to response
   - Verify screen context awareness functions correctly
   - Test memory persistence and retrieval across sessions
   - Validate tool execution through the service architecture

3. Conduct performance testing:
   - Measure startup time (target: under 1 second)
   - Test response latency for various query types
   - Measure memory usage during extended operation
   - Verify system stability under continuous use

4. Documentation verification:
   - Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - Verify architecture diagrams match implementation
   - Test installation and deployment following documentation
   - Have team members review documentation for clarity

5. Final verification against PRD:
   - Create traceability matrix mapping requirements to implementations
   - Verify all functional requirements are satisfied
   - Confirm all performance requirements are met
   - Validate all user experience requirements are achieved
