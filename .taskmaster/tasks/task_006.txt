## Current Status: OCR Implementation Complete, Tesseract Binary Installation Required

### OCR Implementation Status
✅ **Complete**: OCR text extraction functionality has been fully implemented in `src/sovereign/screen_context_manager.py`
✅ **Complete**: Comprehensive test suite with 17 test cases created in `tests/test_ocr_functionality.py`
✅ **Complete**: Image preprocessing pipeline with grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, and scaling
✅ **Complete**: Confidence filtering and bounding box detection
✅ **Complete**: Error handling and performance tracking

### Current Issue
❌ **Blocked**: Tests failing because Tesseract OCR binary is not installed on the system
- Error: "tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH"
- Test Results: 8 failed, 6 passed - all failures due to missing Tesseract binary
- The `pytesseract>=0.3.10` Python library is correctly listed in requirements.txt

### Required Installation Steps
The OCR functionality requires installing the Tesseract OCR binary separately from the Python library:

1. **Download Tesseract**: Get the latest Windows installer from [Tesseract GitHub releases](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
2. **Run Installer**: Install to default location (`C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`)
3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Add `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR` to PATH
   - Set `TESSDATA_PREFIX` to `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata`
4. **Verify Installation**: Run `tesseract -v` in Command Prompt
5. **Re-run Tests**: Execute `python -m pytest tests/test_ocr_functionality.py -v`

### Implementation Details
The OCR system includes:
- **Text Extraction**: Uses `pytesseract.image_to_data()` with confidence filtering
- **Preprocessing**: Grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, sharpening, and scaling
- **Performance**: Tracks OCR timing and text extraction statistics
- **Language Support**: Configurable language support (default: English)
- **Bounding Boxes**: Extracts text location coordinates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with empty results and error logging

### Next Steps
1. Install Tesseract OCR binary on Windows
2. Verify installation with `tesseract -v`
3. Re-run OCR tests to confirm functionality
4. Mark subtask as complete once all tests pass

## 3. Design Secure Storage System [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create an efficient, privacy-focused storage mechanism for screenshots and extracted text, ensuring local-only storage and context windowing.
### Details:
Implement a storage system that retains only recent context (windowing), supports screenshot references, and enforces local storage with no external transmission.

## 4. Develop Privacy and Control Features [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement privacy controls including UI toggles, automatic disabling for sensitive applications, and user-configurable settings.
### Details:
Add clear UI controls for enabling/disabling capture, detect sensitive applications to auto-disable, and expose configuration options for privacy and performance.

## 5. Integrate Context System with AI Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Connect the screen context system to the AI, enabling reference to specific screen elements and seamless context updates.
### Details:
Expose APIs or interfaces for the AI to access extracted text and screenshot references, ensuring real-time updates and minimal latency.
