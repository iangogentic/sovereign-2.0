# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Real-Time Screen Context System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the background screen capture, OCR text extraction, and context integration system to allow the AI to understand and reference the user's current screen content.
# Details:
1. Create ScreenContextManager class with methods:
   - initialize(config)
   - capture_screen()
   - extract_text(screenshot)
   - update_context(text, screenshot_reference)
   - toggle_capture(enabled)
2. Implement configurable screenshot capture interval (default: 3-5 seconds)
3. Integrate high-performance OCR library (e.g., Tesseract or commercial alternative)
4. Create efficient storage mechanism for screenshots and extracted text
5. Implement privacy controls:
   - Clear toggle in UI
   - Automatic disabling for sensitive applications
   - Local-only storage of all captures
6. Add context windowing to manage memory usage
7. Implement screenshot reference system for AI to reference specific screen elements

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure OCR accuracy across different screen content types
2. Test performance impact of background capture
3. Verify privacy controls function correctly
4. Test context integration with AI responses
5. Measure memory usage during extended operation
6. Validate screenshot reference system accuracy
