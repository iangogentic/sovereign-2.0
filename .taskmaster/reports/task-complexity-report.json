			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Long-Term Memory (RAG) System into granular subtasks, covering database schema design, MemoryManager class development, embedding model integration, vector search implementation, context window management, memory pruning, privacy controls, and export/import features. Ensure each subtask is actionable and testable.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and integrating multiple complex components: persistent storage, semantic search, embedding generation, context management, and privacy controls. Each component requires specialized knowledge and careful coordination, resulting in high cyclomatic and cognitive complexity[1][3][5]. The breadth and depth of the requirements justify a high complexity score and a recommendation to expand into at least 10 focused subtasks for effective management and testing."
