### Scenario 7: Cold Startup Performance and Lazy Loading Validation
**Goal:** Validate system startup performance and verify that services load lazily on first use without impacting cold startup time.

**User Persona:** Developer Dave (primary), Manager Mary (secondary)

**Prerequisites:** System completely shut down, baseline SSD system

**Steps:**
1. **Cold Startup Test**:
   - Measure time from system launch to first prompt availability
   - Verify startup time is â‰¤ 1 second
   - Confirm no heavy libraries (torch, cv2, sounddevice) load during startup
2. **Service Lazy Loading Test**:
   - Access each service for the first time and measure load time:
     - Request screen capture (should load OCR/CV libraries on first call)
     - Request voice interaction (should load speech libraries on first call)
     - Request model query (should load model libraries on first call)
   - Verify subsequent calls to same services are significantly faster
3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor system resource usage during startup vs service loading
   - Verify startup resource footprint is minimal
   - Confirm heavy resource usage only occurs on service-specific first use

**Expected Outcome:**
- Cold startup completes in â‰¤ 1 second
- System immediately responsive to basic commands after startup
